            <p class="food__description"> These smoked chicken legs are so versatile and easy! I like to use apple wood
                chips or other fruit woods, but maple is also a great choice. Use your favorite BBQ rub. Letting the
                legs air-dry in the refrigerator overnight, combined with a higher smoking temperature, helps prevent
                rubbery skin that is common when smoking chicken. Serve with your favorite BBQ sauce, if desired.</p>
