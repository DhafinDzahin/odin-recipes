        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p> These smoked chicken legs are so versatile and easy! I like to use apple wood chips or other fruit woods,
            but maple is also a great choice. Use your favorite BBQ rub. Letting the legs air-dry in the refrigerator
            overnight, combined with a higher smoking temperature, helps prevent rubbery skin that is common when
            smoking chicken. Serve with your favorite BBQ sauce, if desired.</p>
        <h3>Ingredient:</h3>
